# Motivation
Besides my master's thesis, the self-organized **Data Science Project** was at the heart of my master's degree. The project was a semester-long group project with the target of building solving a real-world problem using data science and creating a functional product out of it. After a few brainstorming session in our group of four, we landed on the idea of building a travel suggestion application, inspired by <a href="https://x.com/levelsio?ref=levels.io&mx=2" target="_blank">Pieter Levels'</a> <a href="https://nomads.com" target="_blank">Nomad List</a>. We have all been in vacation planning situations where we were stuck and thought...

> I liked that last summer holiday in Barcelona. And that Easter trip to New York! Maybe I could find some similar destination for this summer... something new. But where? Those blog posts are all so subjective and biased. And the travel agencies are just trying to sell me something. I wish I had a neutral source to suggest me some destinations.

This need for an **automated service platform for travel suggestions** based on the user's past travel locations led our group to pursue building exactly such an application.

# My role
From a project management standpoint, all four of us students were in charge to manage the project. We regularly consulted with our professors to ensure we were on the right track. From a technical standpoint, I **collected the data via APIs and Web Scraping** on culture (sights, activities,...), costs, geographical ladscape and weather. Across all categories, I **designed uniform scores**, e.g. with scaling or ratios. I was responsible for the **database design and maintenance** and kept an eye on keeping the **codebase lean**. For our similarity analysis, I **engineered the prompts** for the LLM.

# Approach
Our target was to create an **as objective as possible travel suggestion platform**. We wanted to suggest destinations based on the user's past travel locations and the time period they visited the locations. To realize this we needed to gather various data on the different fascettes of each location. We stored this data in a central database to then conduct the similarity analysis and suggest the most similar travel destinations via a frontend applicationto the user.

# Implementation
The heart of fynd is its database. To understand, for which categories we collected data, have a look at our tabs in the application:

</div>

We collected the data for our categories from a wide range of sources making use of APIs and Web Scraping. We captured **cultural diversity** through the number of dining options, touristic sights as well as leisure activities. For the **cost category**, we combined flight prices, hotel prices and cost of living. **Reachability** measures the time it takes to get to the destination. We estimated routes for automobile, public transport and flights. We further collected historical **weather and geographical data**. **Safety and health data** from governmental authorities and NGOs completed our set of categories. We stored all this data in a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> database hosted on <a href="https://www.bw-cloud.org/en/" target="_blank">bwCloud</a>.

Based on the data, we calculated granular **scores** for each category. Some of the scores were time- and origin-dependent (e.g. reachability) and thus needing an adaptable frontend depending on the user input. We then used these scores to generate **textual summaries**. These provide the user with more in-depth information in which regard a city stands out from the rest. Using our standardized scores, we were able to compare each city with the user's previous destinations to assign a **relevance**.

<div class="flex justify-center items-center">

</div>

As displayed above, we calculated the relevance metric as the average Euclidian distance of the all previous destinations to all other destinations, the highest relevance indicating the smallest distance, i.e. most similar result. This yields the best matching destinations for the user. The user's preference settings can adjust the relevance even further (e.g. weighing of categories, adjusting whether category should be similar or not). All this data is unified and nicely displayed to make the user experience as smooth as possible.

Have a look at the demo video below to see how the application works. This was our final product at the end of the Data Science Project.
