# Motivation
After finishing some of my projects at work as well as university, I wanted to create a website to present them and the knowledge gained. However, I didn't want to just simply use a drag-and-drop website builder but strived for an independent development without any restrictions. I used this as an opportunity to tap into an unknown domain, Rust, and used the "React-like" framework </a> <a href="https://yew.rs" target="_blank">Yew</a> (WebAssembly) along with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a> for styling.

# Learnings
Obviously, you are currently on the latest iteration of my website and can play around with the UI and learn about my experiences. Some highlights of the development were:
- Learn how to structure a frontend directory with pages and components (though definitely not perfect yet)
- Rust types and borrowing data
- Setting up and publishing website with domain, CI/CD from GitHub
- CSS concepts (started with vanilla CSS, moved to hybrid with TailwindCSS, now fully switched to TailwindCSS)
- Integrate content into webapp through Markdown and YAML

And as the website remains in constant development, I will always learn and practice new web application concepts :)
